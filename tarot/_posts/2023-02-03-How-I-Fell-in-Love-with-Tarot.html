<p>About twelve years ago, when I was smack-dab in the middle of a divorce  from my first husband, I went to a party/talent show at a small bar on the edge of downtown Edmonton. I didn't know many people and I was shy, but also determined to have a good time because I'd found childcare and escaped, for a few hours, the overwhelming complexity and sadness of my life at that time. There was a Tarot reader there, an effeminate man with a strong voice. My reading made him uncomfortable. It was all swords. Ten of swords. I still remember how perfectly the image represented my situation. I bought my first tarot deck the next day.</p>
