   	<p>The newest of my passions. When I was divorcing my first husband I went to a party / talent show at a small bar on the edge of downtown. It was in a rambshackled old building and was full of people who I kind of knew, but wasn't close to. I was shy, but determined to have a good time because I'd found childcare and escaped, for a few hours, the overwhelming complexity and sadness of my life at that time. There was a Tarot reader there, an effeminate man with a strong voice. My reading made him uncomfortable. It was all swords. Ten of swords. I still remember, twelve years later, how vividly the image represented my life.</p>
