   	<p>When I first learned to read the beauty of words swept me up - poetry, novels, quotes that seemed to make the whole of my confusing human existance make sense for at least a minute. I wanted to join in on that. I would sit out in the feild behind my parents house and speak words. Our two black dogs - William and Dusty - would watch me as I let words flow out of my mouth savouring them like fruit.</p>
