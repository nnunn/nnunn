   	<p>I have wanted to write since I can young. When the beauty of words swept me up - poetry, beautiful novels, quotes that seemed to make the whole of my confusing human existance make sense for at least a minute. I wanted to join in on that. I would sit out in the feild behind my parents house and speak words. Our two black dogs - William and Dusty - would watch me as I let words flow out of my mouth savouring them like fruit.</p>
