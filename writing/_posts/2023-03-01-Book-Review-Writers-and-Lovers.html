Writers and Lovers by Lily King is, as the quote on the cover states, "Gorgeous!" <!--more-->A literary fiction novel where nothing much happens, Writers and Lovers captures the experience of grief perfectly. Casey, an aspiring writer and waitress, struggles with finances, health, and relationships, but most of all with grief. Casey's mom died recently, suddenly, and Casey is left mostly alone in the world, other than her dad who is, in her words, a pervert.  <div class="dblue rounded p-2 w-50 float-end ms-3 mt-3"> <img src="/assets/images/archive/king.png" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="The cover of Writers and Lovers by Lily King" /></div>

<p class="mt-3">From the moment I picked up the book, I was hooked. King has created a character so real that I often felt like I could reach out and touch her, in the restaurant she works at, or at home in the shack she lives in. King also created a wonderful and realistic cast of secondary characters who play. She beautifully describes the way that grief suddenly creeps up on you. She had me in tears, reminded of my own grief at my father dying, even though it's been 10 years. In one scene she sees a group of geese who make her feel good and she wants to call her mom and tell her about the geese, but of course, her mother is dead. I still feel that startling when I realized I can't talk to my dad, that small things I know he'd like are now only mine to like.  </p>

<p>As an aspiring (I kind of hate that word) writer myself, I really appreciated the way King describes writing, both as a life-line and as a curse. Casey's struggle to finish her novel, muster up the courage to allow someone to read it, revise it, and finally send it out to agents was very realistic. </p>

<p>My only criticism of the book was the ending. It was just a little too pat and perfect for my liking. Overall though, I love Writers and Lovers and would definitely recommend if you like slice-of-life perfection!</p>
