<p>How can I make writing feel less like pulling teeth and more like brushing my teeth? <!--more-->I've been trying to figure this out for a long time. Sometimes writing comes easily, but often it feels really, really hard and a little scary. Sometimes I sit down to write and all I end up doing is checking my email a million times, changing my desktop background on my laptop, reading some article about how to build habits.</p>

<p>I'm trying not to beat myself up about my lack of focus, my talant for procrastination. I know I'm not alone and I also know (after years and years of negative self-talk) that calling myself a lazy idiot doesn't actually get me writing, or if it does it doesn't get me writing with joy and creativity. No matter how badly I want to write, I don't want to do it if the only way I can get words onto the page is to be mean to myself.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the idea of habit. Seems like that's the way forward over anything else. Just make writing something I do, not something I think about doing, or do sometimes when the mood hits me, but somthing I do everyday - like brushing my teeth. It is a simple idea, but brillant in it's simplicity.
