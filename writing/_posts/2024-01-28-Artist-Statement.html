description: My artist statement about my writing.

Writing is my way of honouring that small voice inside me that wants to share its secrets. Writing is how I understand the world. It is impossible to put into words the infinite and expanding chaos of sensations and experience that it is to be human<!--more-->, and yet this impossible task is what gives my life meaning, what gives some form to the shapelessness. </p>

<p>I am fascinated by how stories shape our being, create our identities. We are constantly told the story of who we are - by our families, by our subconscious, by our society, by our history. Writing inspirits me to dissect these stories and to birth new stories from the scraps of that dissection. </p>

<p>I love language and the subversion of language. I love the moment where you reach the limit of what language can do -  that moment of pain when you see that there is no way to describe what you are, what you feel, where you stand in this chaos, but somehow you manage to  capture a small bit of it through metaphor, or character, or some brilliant and specific detail. I am inspired by writers who grapple with these edges of representation, who manifest these magical shining moments of knowing and connection, who reveal and celebrate the fragile and fallacious nature of this thing we call life. </p>
