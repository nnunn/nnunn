I had a free day today, which almost never happens. My husband is away, my kids are away.<!--more--> Other than an annoying kitten attacking me as I type, I actually have some time to dedicate to my writing. I had it last night too, but instead of writing I ended up watching about 4 hours of Real Housewives of Orange County. So this morning I woke up with fire in my belly and shame in my heart.

	I started with a plan. Today I would use the Pomodoro method to do at least an hour and a half of solid writing. For those of you who don't know, the Pomodoro method breaks a work block into smaller chunks with breaks. The normal Pomodoro is 25 minutes focus the 5 minutes of rest - do that four times and then a longer 15 minute rest. I (sadly) can't currently do a full 25 minutes of focused writing. Honestly, I have about 12 minutes in me before I get distracted, tired, unfocused. So I used this handy <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">online pomodoro timer</a> which allows you to choose how long each focussed period is. I went with 3 rounds of 12 minutes and did that 3 times (walking the dogs or resting in between rounds). So all in all I wrote for 108 minutes - it was very productive, getting me through two scenes I've wanted to write for awhile. By the last round (round 9) I felt physically tired and I had to psych myself out like an athlete. <em>You can do this!</em> and  <em>just make it through these 12 minutes and you can veg out in front of the tv!</em></p>
	<p>	It felt great to set a goal and follow through on it. Now I just have to go back and edit what I wrote -- groan. </p>
