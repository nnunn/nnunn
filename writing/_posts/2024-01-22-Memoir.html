description: "Writing a memoir."
---

I've put the novel aside for awhile. I wasn't getting anywhere with it and it was sucking all the joy out of writing. I seemed to just be spinning inside this complicated and unknowable structure <!--more--> and every time I made one change I was happy with there would be a hundred more changes that I'd needed to make. I know I will return to fiction writing one day. But for now I've decided to mine my own experiences and write a memoir. I am going to dig through all the layers of my life and write about what I find.

<p>So far the project is going well. I've written almost 50,000 words and I have some material that I'm really happy with.</p>
