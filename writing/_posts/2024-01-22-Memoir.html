I've put the novel aside for awhile. I wasn't getting anywhere with it and it was sucking all the joy out of writing. I seemed to just be spinning inside this complicated and unknowable structure <!--more--> and for every change I made to the manuscript there would be a hundred more changes that I needed to make. I know I will return to fiction writing one day. But for now I've decided to mine (excavate) my own experiences and write a memoir. I am going to dig through all the layers of my life and write about what I find.

<p>So far the project is going well. I've written almost 50,000 words and I have some material that I'm really happy with. <a href="https://www.carissahalton.com/">Carissa</a> from my writer's group suggested that I try to get one of the peices published as a stand alone essay so I've been sending that out. It's the first time that I'm sending out work since I stopped last January. I find trying to get things published really draining.</p>
<p>My main goal in writing the memoir is to reinvigorate my love of writing and so far I have accomplished that goal. Writing about my life feels less difficult then creating an entire fictional world. I am able to write small sections each day and I've been enjoying just letting the words come without too much judgement or need to structure them.</p>
