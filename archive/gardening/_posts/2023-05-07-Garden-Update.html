description: Update on my gardening work!

<p>I was outside in the garden yesterday preparing the beds for the brassicas - cabbage, Cauliflower, Koolrabi, broccoli, and for the lettuce seedlings.<!--more-->  The plants are doing ok, although it's been far too hot so I've had to keep them all in the shade (30 degrees in May - yuck!). I'm trying not to dig a lot in the garden as I subscribe to the <a href="https://charlesdowding.co.uk/start-no-dig/">no dig</a> method. However, there is just too much couch grass and dandelions to truly do no dig. So I am trying to dig just enough to get the weeds without destroying the soil structure. Of course it doesn't help that everything is bone, bone dry. </p>

<p>In the greenhouse the peppers, tomatoes, and flowers all seem to be doing well. I had to throw away all my Jalapeno peppers because they got some sort of fungus that turned all their leaves brown. Thankfully I have a few more smaller ones growing so I hope I get some Jalapeno peppers. I also have Mike's hot peppers and another pepper. One of them is already blooming!

<p>My flower seedlings are all doing well. The morning glory plants are trying to climb up the tomatos. I hope it doesn't get really cold at night because hauling in all 15 tomato plants is annoying. </p>
