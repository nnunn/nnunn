The root chakra is what grounds you in the physical world.<!--more--> It represents stability and safety, but also a source of grounding earth energy.

<p class="mt-2">Before I start the reading let me preface this post with a short tangent on cultural appropriation. One of the things I like about Tarot is that it has European roots and is therefore somewhat connected to my own heritage (British, French, Swedish). With Tarot I don't feel like I am co-opting -- and most likely misinterpreting -- another culture's sacred tradition. Chakras, on the other hand, are distinctly NOT in my cultural background and I do feel a little trepidation in referring to them, but I hope that my fascination  with chakras falls more in the cultural <em>appreciation</em> camp rather than the cultural <em>appropriation</em> camp. I have a deep respect for the Tantrik tradition that chakras come from  (India around 600-1300 CE). I know that my understanding of chakras is not true to those ancient Indian teachings but is a westernized version that comes from new world yoga and western occult traditions who DID culturally appropriate those teachings and probably mangled them in the process. Check out <a href="https://hareesh.org/blog/2016/2/5/the-real-story-on-the-chakras">The real story on the Chakras</a> for an excellent discussion of the history of chakras. </p>

	<p>The first card, where the Root Chakra is connected to the ground, is the lovers reversed. Something in the way that you relate to the great grounding force of nature, the earth, is unconnected and immature. This could indicate an inability to be authentic in your sexuality, or perhaps a relationship that is not allowing you open yourself to love. But the potential for connection is very clearly there. The lovers upright would have indicated a deep connection with the earth. Perhaps spending time sitting quietly on the ground could encourage this connection.</p>

	<p>The next card represents what is radiating out from your root to your left side. The left side (in western esotaric traditions) represents the lunar, the feminine, intuition. The Queen of Wands is a beautiful, energetic, older woman who is aligned with her femininity, but full of fire and energy. Your feminine side is strong, vital, and connected to the energy of the earth. </p>

	<p>On the right we have The Tower reversed. In the masculine, rational realm of your physical body, you may feel like you are on shaky ground. It could be that something has shaken your belief in your safety, but you are safe, you only need to let go of what you think should be and accept what actually is. </p>

	<p>Finally, we have the magician in the top position -- connecting up and into the sacral chakra. This is a beautiful card which speaks to your ability to use the power of your root chakra to make magic -- to pull something out of thin air (or in this case from the ground). The magician brings things into reality.</p>
	<p>This root chakra reading has three Major Arcana cards and a court card which suggests the root chakra is very important to you right now. The Lovers reversed, and the Tower reversed represent an imbalance, but not a serious or insurmountable one. With only a small shift (perhaps some meditation on your connection to the earth and some visualization of stability) you are primed to use the power of the earth to manifest your dreams. </p>
