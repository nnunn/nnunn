Everytime I have to write a cover letter for a job or a biography for a writing submission I have this moment of dread. Do I really have to <em>sell myself</em>. I mean can't people just read my writing or talk to me and get a sense of me from that? But here's my effort at self-description...</p>
	<p>My name is Natasha Nunn and I'm a writer, gardener, and tarot reader. I've been pursuing these passions for years and I've decided it's time to put myself and my thoughts out onto the internet for people to stumble onto (hopefully). And if no one stumbles onto it, at least I'll have a nice little archive of my passion projects.</p>
	<p>I live on an acreage outside of Stony Plain (Alberta, Canada) with my three kids and my husband. I have two incredible sisters who I don't see enough (<a href="https://www.katenunnlaw.com/">Kate</a> and <a href="https://tessanunn.com">Tessa</a>). Being the youngest of a trio of girls definitly shaped me. Sometimes I still feel like a baby, unformed and just trying to get the attention of my beloved older siblings. But that feeling has faded as my own childen have grown up and I've truly moved into adulthood - which didn't happen for me until after 40.</p>
	<p>I'm an academic librarian during work hours.</p>
