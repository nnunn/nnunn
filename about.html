	<p>I don't really like writing about myself. Everytime I have to write a cover letter for a job or a biography for a writing submission I have this moment of dread. Do I really have to <em>sell myself</em>. I mean can't people just read my writing or talk to me and get a sense of me from that? Perhaps it's a lingering distrust of capitalism, <div class="red-bg float-end rounded ml-5"><img src="/assets/images/me.png" class="p-3" /></div>but really it's time for me to get over it.</p>
	<p>My name is Natasha Nunn and I'm a writer, gardener, and tarot reader. I've been pursueing these passions for years and I've decided it's time to put myself and my thoughts out onto the internet for people to stumble onto (hopefully). And if no one stumbles onto it, at least I'll have a nice little archive of my passion projects.</p>
	<p>I'm 47, live on an acerage outside of Stony Plain (Alberta, Canada), and I'm an academic librarain. I have 3 kids - twin 16 year old boys and a 6 year old boy.</p>
