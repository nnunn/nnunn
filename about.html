	<p>I don't really like writing about myself. Everytime I have to write a cover letter for a job or a biography for a writing submission I have this moment of dread. Do I really have to <em>sell myself</em>. I mean can't people just read my writing or talk to me and get a sense of me from that? <div class="red-bg float-end rounded ms-4 p-2"><img src="/assets/images/me.png" class="rounded img-fluid" /></div></p>
	<p>My name is Natasha Nunn and I'm a writer, gardener, and tarot reader. I've been pursuing these passions for years and I've decided it's time to put myself and my thoughts out onto the internet for people to stumble onto (hopefully). And if no one stumbles onto it, at least I'll have a nice little archive of my passion projects.</p>
	<p>I live on an acreage outside of Stony Plain (Alberta, Canada) with my three kids and my husband.</p>
