I planted a tray of flowers the day before yesterday - all the old fashioned flowers that I love <!--more--> - Marigolds, Calendula, Zinnias, Sunflowers, Alysum. Having flowers in the garden is really important to me. Not only for the bees and other bugs, but for their beauty and splendor. Flowers bring me pure joy.

</div>
<p>I also went out and got some cosmo seed off my standing dead ones out front. Last year I learned that if you grow old Cosmo seeds then the plant will grow incredible foliage, but not flower. So this year I'm using seeds right off the plant. I'm also hoping that a lot of the cosmos will self-seed. </p>

<p>The pepper seedlings have now spent a few hours in the greenhouse. I have to watch the temperature and bring them in as soon as it gets under 15 degrees Celsius in there, but I can tell they are happy to be bathed in sun. Even with the lights they lean their heads towards the window in the house. </p>

<p>The brassica I planted are doing ok. I didn't get as many Cauliflower come up as I hoped I would so I'm going to do another planting of those. </p>


<p>Also my seeding trays are getting a little confused so for my own notes -- I planted ten each of Parsley, Pansy, Cosmo, Summertime Lettuce, Lettuce Lattuga, Green Cabbage, Brocolli, Kale, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts. </p> 

<p>And then in the other tray I have Golden Cherry Tomatoes, Iceberg Lettuce (lengthwise) and then Zinnia, Calendula, Sun Flowers, Marigolds, and Snap Dragons. </p><div class="dgreen rounded text-center mb-3 p-2 mt-3 w-50 float-end ms-3">

<p>One closely seeded lettuce tray. 

<p>Oh and last night I accidentally left my lettuce and brussel sprout seedlings outside. The brussel sprouts died but the lettuce actually lived through the night! I went down to -4 C.</p>

<p>I'm really getting into the swing here - potted up my tomatoes yesterday and I will probably get my Brassica potted up tomorrow. </p>
