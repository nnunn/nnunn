description: Sorting, storing, and buying seeds

I love seeds. Love, love, love seeds! They are magic tiny bundles of amazingness and hope.<!--more--> Each one holds the key to growth, individuation, and the beauty of the life cycle. Every year as I push seeds down into the earth and then watch each one grow into what it is supposed to be I feel like a magician.
<p class="mt-3">And just like attempting to buy soil in February, buying seeds makes me feel like the garden is right around the corner!  But I'm trying to learn from the mistakes of yesteryear. I have been guilty of buying far too many seeds, not storing them properly, and not researching which seeds last and which don't (which led to my carefully tended cosmo plants having incredible foliage and NO FLOWERS!). So this year I took out all my old seeds and sorted through them before I even looked at the seed catalogues. I learnt a lot too. Here's a handy list for how long seeds last:</p>

<p>The other thing I learned last year is not to plant okra in our climate so I'll take that one right off the list, also watermelon. I know some people can grow melons up here in zone 4 but I've never had any luck with them so I'm going to stick to the tried and true veggies this year. The one thing I'm going to try this year that I've never had much luck with is cucumbers, but I'm going to grow them in my little greenhouse instead of outside. The only seed I saved myself last year were cilantro seeds (delicious coriander)</p>
<p>So after throwing away some seed packets, but keeping a lot of them, I went through the three seed catalogues I recieved in the mail. This year I've decided to stick with <a href="https://ttseeds.com/">T&T seads</a> in Manitoba. I really liked their seeds last year. I like the seed packets, which are brown and unassuming, but have very clear labels and fold up well for storage. I also like their website - <a href="https://www.richters.com/">Richters seeds</a> (in Ontario), and <a href="https://www.lindenbergseeds.ca/">Lindenberg Seeds</a> (also in Manitoba) has some great options, but you have to call in or mail in to order seeds. I'm far too much of an internet baby to do that.</p>
<p> I ordered lots and lots of Jalapeno pepper seeds since I didn't have any saved from last year and I loved having a lot of Jalapeno pepper plants. I'm going to plant even more this year and feed them better too since I think I could have got even more fruit last year. For a little over a month last year I made quick pickles with my fresh Jalapenos and everyone loved them. I think I'll make some real pickled Jalepenos this year if I get a good crop.</p>
<p>I also ordered.
