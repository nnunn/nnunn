description: Transplanting my peppers and brussels. Planting more peppers, tomatos, and brassicas.

My little peppers, brussel sprouts, and lettuces are ready for transplanting - when I see those first true leaves I know there is probably enough roots to move them to a bigger container.<!--more--> It always amazes me how many roots are on these tiny seedlings.

They work really well - the biggest downside is that they don't hold water very well so you have to be on top of watering, but since this is the time of year I'm most excited about gardening, I actually like having something to do everyday.

<p>I did a little more research on Pro-Mix HP and it looks like it has no nutrients and really loses water fast so I've decided to add a little bit of plant food to the watering now that I've done the transplanting. Today was so warm out that I could have put the seedlings out in the greenhouse for a few hours!</p>


<p>I also planted two more trays of egg cartons - the first tray has 10 Roma Tomatoes, 10 Beefsteak Tomatoes, 6 Cherry Tomatoes, 6 Jalapeno Peppers, 6 Hot Mike pepper. The second tray has 10 each of Red Cabbage, Cauliflower, Broccoli, 6 Koolrabi, 6 Kale (I've never planted those before) and a tray of Basil. </p>

<p>I'll check back in when this new planting starts to sprout. I'm also going to go out an put hoops on a couple of my raised beds. They way the sun is shining right now the soil will heat up really fast under low tunnels!</p>
