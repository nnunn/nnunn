 <p class="mb-0">It's futile to start gardening in February in zone 4, but I thought I could at least get some soil (because I'm so excited to get things started!).<!--more--> I'd seen a short video by <a href="https://joegardener.com/">Joe Gardener</a> and he'd mentioned Promix BX, so I searched around and found that our local Rona had 52 bags of Pro-mix BX available. I thought I could at least get my grouing medium ready to go. The last couple of years I haven't been super diligent about what growing medium I'm using for my seedlings and I definitely noticed that some thrived while others didn't. I suspect it's because I was using different soil, but because I hadn't recorded what soil I used there was not way to tell. This year I want to be more scientific.</p>

 <p>The lady behind the till at Rona looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if they had their soil somewhere (I'd looked around a bit, but of course the gardening section was closed). It was minus 18 degrees celsuis (-0.4f) outsite with a brutal wind and no ground in site under the snow blowing around. But she looked Pro-mix on the computer and agreed that they did have 52 large bags. She rang through my order and sent me to the yard for pick-up.</p>
 <p>The yard guy told me to drive to the far corner of the lot.
