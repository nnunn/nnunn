title:  "Buying Soil in February"
catagory: "Gardening"
---

 <p>It's futile to start gardening in February in zone 4, but I thought I could at least get some soil. I'd seen a short video by <a href="https://joegardener.com/">Joe Gardener</a> and he'd mentioned Promix BX, so I searched around and found that our local Rona had 52 bags of Pro-mix BX available. I know it's way too early, but I can at least get my grouing medium ready to go.</p>
 <p>The lady behind the till looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if they had their soil somewhere (I'd looked around a bit, but of course the gardening section was closed).</p>
